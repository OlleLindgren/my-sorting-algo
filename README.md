# my-sorting-algo

This repository contains my implementation of a sorting algorithm that I have invented. The function `sort_list()` is equivalent to the default `sorted()` in python, and the time complexity should be close to O(N) for most inputs.

After researching sorting algorithms for a bit, I have come to realize that this is equivalent to radix/bucket sort.
